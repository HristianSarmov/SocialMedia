As for my next big project I made it as a personal challenge to see show how much I had learned about web development
and in particular HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Php and Laravel by creating a simple social media platform from the 
ground up. This is a website with the basic functionalities of a social media network. It's all about connecting 
people around the world in a simple social media setting.

## Development:

I started off by learning from all available to me resources anything I could about the basics of web development 
that being HTML, CSS, Javascript and Php. In the first iteration of the project I was using the Laravel templating engine: 
Blade combined with Bootstrap for my front-end purposes. I tried, tested, implemented and learned a lot about many web 
concepts, those being sessions, cookies, storages and more. One of the biggest leaps in difficulty for me in this project
were the SQL queries. 

When I started this project I was going to do it without any frameworks, but the scale became too large and putting things 
in order and making development more efficient became an issue which led me to learning Laravel.

Learning and properly implementing Laravel meant that I rewrote the project from scratch. This time using everything 
available to me: Changing the HTML code to implement Laravel's Blade Template Engine and organizing the back end to 
take full advantage of the framework and it's structure. This way of working continued with me learning the ins and outs
of Laravel, it's Blade Template Engine, it's Eloquent ORM, it's Artisan console, it's tools such as Laravel Telescope
which became integral to the developmental process. This version of the project is inside the social_media folder of 
this repository.

After I had finished the project using these technologies I decided to expand on it while learning something new, and 
that was React, the final version of the project is written with every technology so far combined. Starting the project 
for a third time from scratch this time using the full package of tools at my disposal. All my known Laravel tools, 
many integral React packages and components and expanding on past knowledge of the previously mentioned technologies. 
This final version of the project can be found inside the social_media_react folder of this repository.
