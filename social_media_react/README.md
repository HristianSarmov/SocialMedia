### This version of the project uses Laravel and React 

## Development: 
As this was the third time I was making this project I had a good understanding of how the development was going to go, 
but as I decided to learn the React Javascript library, which was my first complex front end building tool that I had used 
and with it came the difficulties of learning JSX, the component lifecycle and changing the way users interact with the 
project due to React's Single Page Architecture. Exploring many different React libraries dynamic front end components 
and combining them with a powerful back end framework like Laravel made my codebase more modular and maintainable.
