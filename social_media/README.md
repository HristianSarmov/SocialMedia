### This version of the project uses Laravel and it's Blade template engine

## Development: 

As I already had some basic understanding of the languages that I was going to use here the biggest challenge
of making this project was navigaring through the Laravel ecosystem which brought me to understand such concepts as 
ORM and more specifically I learned Laravel's Eloquent ORM and researching all of the useful artisan commands.
Learning all about Blade and it's reusable layouts and components and it's sytax simplicity helped the process a lot. 
After a time I mastered these technologies and after scouring through the documentation of Laravel and with that 
came probably the most useful tool I could find which was Telescope and that led to a massive increase in work efficiency.
The local development cycle became a lot more managable using it with all processes and events being documented in real time. 
This project taught me a lot about file handling, web development and efficiency in general.
